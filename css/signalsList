Signal 	Default Action 	Description
____________________________________
SIGABRT 	ii 	Process abort signal.
SIGALRM 	i 	Alarm clock.
SIGFPE 	ii 	Erroneous arithmetic operation.
SIGHUP 	i 	Hangup.
SIGILL 	ii 	Illegal instruction.
SIGINT 	i 	Terminal interrupt signal.
SIGKILL 	i 	Kill (cannot be caught or ignored).
SIGPIPE 	i 	Write on a pipe with no one to read it.
SIGQUIT 	ii 	Terminal quit signal.
SIGSEGV 	ii 	Invalid memory reference.
SIGTERM 	i 	Termination signal.
SIGUSR1 	i 	User-defined signal 1.
SIGUSR2 	i 	User-defined signal 2.
SIGCHLD 	iii 	Child process terminated or stopped.
SIGCONT 	v 	Continue executing, if stopped.
SIGSTOP 	iv 	Stop executing (cannot be caught or ignored).
SIGTSTP 	iv 	Terminal stop signal.
SIGTTIN 	iv 	Background process attempting read.
SIGTTOU 	iv 	Background process attempting write.
SIGBUS 	ii 	Access to an undefined portion of a memory object.
SIGPOLL 	i 	Pollable event.
SIGPROF 	i 	Profiling timer expired.
SIGSYS 	ii 	Bad system call.
SIGTRAP 	ii 	Trace/breakpoint trap.
SIGURG 	iii 	High bandwidth data is available at a socket.
SIGVTALRM 	i 	Virtual timer expired.
SIGXCPU 	ii 	CPU time limit exceeded.
SIGXFSZ 	ii 	File size limit exceeded.


The default actions are as follows:

i:	Abnormal termination of the process. The process is terminated with all the consequences of _exit() except that the status made available to wait() and waitpid() indicates abnormal termination by the specified signal. 
ii:	Abnormal termination of the process. Additionally, implementation-dependent abnormal termination actions, such as creation of a core file, may occur. 
iii:	Ignore the signal. 
iv:	Stop the process. 
v:	Continue the process, if it is stopped; otherwise ignore the signal.
